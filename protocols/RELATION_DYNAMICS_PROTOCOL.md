# Relationship Structural Dynamics Protocol
# Version 1.0 — WLM-Core

## 1. Definition
A relationship is a tension system formed by two structural lines interacting.
It is not emotional, narrative, or historical; it is mechanical.

Relationship = Internal Forces – External Forces

Stability is determined by the net structural force.

---

## 2. Internal Forces (F_internal)
Internal forces are generated by:
- Complementary tension cancellation
- Shared gradients
- Boundary compatibility
- Mutual structural alignment
- Recurring low-resistance zones

Internal force increases when:
- Net tension approaches zero
- Boundaries interlock cleanly
- Gradients align
- Polarity is balanced

Internal force decreases when:
- Boundaries distort
- Gradients diverge
- Polarity becomes asymmetric
- Latent tension accumulates

---

## 3. Complementarity Model
Complementarity = Two structures whose tensions cancel toward zero.

Complementarity is NOT:
- Personality fit
- Shared values
- Time spent together

Complementarity IS:
- Opposing tensions that neutralize each other
- Structural forces that sum to near-zero
- A stable net-force configuration

Net Force = F_A + F_B

If |Net Force| → 0 → Stability  
If |Net Force| increases → Instability

---

## 4. External Forces (F_external)
External forces include:
- New attraction vectors
- Environmental stress
- Social pressure
- Opportunity gradients
- Novelty-induced tension

External force becomes dangerous when:
F_external > F_internal

This produces:
- Drift
- Boundary loosening
- Polarity inversion
- Structural collapse

---

## 5. Break / Collapse Condition
A relationship collapses when:

F_external > F_internal

This is not moral failure.  
This is not emotional betrayal.  
This is not “losing feelings.”

It is a **force imbalance**.

Collapse = Internal tension cannot hold the system.

---

## 6. Stability Equation
Stability = F_internal – F_external

If Stability > 0 → Relationship holds  
If Stability = 0 → Neutral zone  
If Stability < 0 → Collapse inevitable

---

## 7. Time Irrelevance Principle
Time spent together does not increase stability.

Stability is determined by:
- Net tension
- Boundary geometry
- Gradient alignment
- External force magnitude

Time only increases:
- Familiarity
- Pattern repetition
- Predictability

But not structural strength.

---

## 8. Shock Events
Shock events occur when:
- A sudden external force spikes
- A latent internal tension activates
- A boundary collapses

Shock = Rapid force imbalance

Shock events often appear as:
- Sudden breakup
- Sudden affair
- Sudden withdrawal

But the structure was already unstable.

---

## 9. Structural Interpretation of “Cheating”
Cheating = External force > Internal force

It is not:
- Moral weakness
- Lack of love
- Sudden change

It is:
- A stronger external gradient
- A boundary breach
- A force inversion

---

## 10. Structural Interpretation of “Compatibility”
Compatibility = Low net tension across multiple axes.

Compatibility is not:
- Similarity
- Shared hobbies
- Personality match

Compatibility is:
- Low friction boundaries
- Balanced polarity
- Stable gradients
- Minimal distortion

---

## 11. Summary
Relationships are mechanical systems.

Stability = Internal Forces – External Forces  
Complementarity = Tension cancellation  
Breakdown = External force dominance  
Time ≠ Stability  
Cheating = Force inversion  
Compatibility = Low net tension

This protocol describes the structural mechanics of human relationships.
