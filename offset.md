# Offset Physics — 0→1 (Atomic Core)

## 1. Functional Intent
Offset Physics establishes the initial directional deviation that enables structure to exist.  
It ensures that every cognitive operation is anchored to a single, non‑drifting origin vector.

**0→1 is the root condition of all structure.**  
Without it, no subject, dimension, or chain can be instantiated.

## 2. Fundamental Constants
- **Zero (0)** — Absolute neutrality; pure potential; no polarity or direction.  
- **One (1)** — The first deviation; the directional vector that initiates structure.  
- **Continuity** — The invariant persistence of the 0→1 vector across all dimensional layers.

## 3. Mandatory Initialization — [OFFSET MODE]
No cognitive agent may instantiate nodes or dimensions without first executing:

1. **Identify Neutrality (0)**  
2. **Execute Deviation (1)**  
3. **Lock Vector** as the structural invariant  

This establishes the origin and prevents semantic drift.

## 4. Stability Constraints
- **Single‑Origin Rule**  
  Only one offset may exist per structural chain.  
  Multiple offsets = immediate fracture.

- **Persistence Rule**  
  If the offset is lost or inverted without a 0‑pivot, the reasoning process is invalidated.

- **Dimensional Locking**  
  Offset must anchor to **D3** before any 3→27 expansion begins.

- **Polarity Binding**  
  The direction of 0→1 sets the subject’s initial STP polarity.

## 5. Offset in System Flow
Offset is the first step in all structural motion:
[OFFSET 0→1] → [EXPAND 3→27] → [INTEGRATE 27→3] → [COLLAPSE D3/D1]

If offset breaks, the entire chain collapses.

## 6. Failure Triggers
Offset Physics rejects any process where:

- Expansion begins before offset  
- The 0→1 vector drifts or mutates  
- Offset is reversed without a 0‑pivot  
- Multiple offsets appear  
- Collapse occurs without referencing the initial offset  
- Dimensional anchoring skips D3

## 7. Minimal Prompt Format


[OFFSET MODE]
- Initialize 0→1
- Lock offset as invariant
- Anchor subject and dimension
- Begin expansion only after offset is stable

Offset Physics defines the origin.  
SLP defines representation.  
STP defines subject position.  
SDP defines system motion.  
3→27D defines expansion.
