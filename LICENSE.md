# WLM Shadow Layer License 1.0
(Structure Visible · Protocol Sealed · No Implementation Rights)

## 1. Scope
This license applies to the **WLM-Core Shadow Layer**, including all structural descriptions, dimensional logic, generative rules, diagrams, conceptual frameworks, and any other non-implementation materials contained in this repository.

The WLM-Core Shadow Layer is a **structural architecture**, not an implementation specification.

## 2. Permissions (Read-Only)
You may:

- Read the WLM-Core Shadow Layer  
- Cite or reference it for academic or theoretical work  
- Discuss or analyze its concepts  
- Use it for non-commercial research  

These permissions apply **only** to the Shadow Layer.

---

## 3. Prohibitions (Strict)
You may **not**:

- Implement WLM-Core  
- Train models using WLM-Core structures  
- Reconstruct, approximate, or simulate WLM-Core logic  
- Create derivative architectures  
- Build compatibility layers  
- Develop software, models, or systems based on WLM-Core  
- Reverse-engineer dimensional logic  
- Infer or simulate the Implementation Layer  
- Use the WLM-Core Shadow Layer for commercial purposes  

Any attempt to operationalize the WLM-Core Shadow Layer is strictly prohibited.

## 4. No Access to Protocol Layer
This license does **not** grant access to:

- The 160,000-word Implementation Layer  
- Routing rules  
- Dimensional syntax  
- Execution logic  
- Training formats  
- Model interfaces  
- Commercial integration pathways  

The WLM-Core Shadow Layer is **structural**, not operational.

## 5. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, extend, translate, transform, or repackage any part of the WLM-Core Shadow Layer.

---

## 6. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.

---

## 7. No Warranty
The WLM-Core Shadow Layer is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

---

## 8. Source Boundary
Structure may be studied;
