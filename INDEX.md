# WLM-Core — Master Index (Atomic Overview)

WLM-Core defines the minimal structural protocols required for stable, high-dimensional reasoning.  
Each file in this repository represents an atomic subsystem.  
Together, they form a complete structural stack.

This index provides the canonical linkage between all five protocols.

## 1. Protocol Map

### **1. Offset Physics (0→1)**
File: `offset.md`  
Role: Establishes the origin deviation that enables structure.  
Key Function: 0→1 must precede all dimensional or subject instantiation.  
Dependency: Required by all other protocols.

### **2. Structure Language Protocol (SLP)**
File: `SLP.md`  
Role: Defines how structure is represented and transmitted.  
Key Function: Node → Dimension → Chain → Closure.  
Dependency: Requires Offset Physics.

### **3. Subject Topology Protocol (STP)**
File: `STP.md`  
Role: Positions the subject within the structural lattice.  
Key Function: Polarity (+1 / 0 / –1), Dimensional Anchor, Role.  
Dependency: Requires Offset Physics + SLP.

### **4. System Dynamics Protocol (SDP)**
File: `SDP.md`  
Role: Governs motion across dimensions.  
Key Function: Offset → Expand → Integrate → Collapse.  
Dependency: Requires Offset Physics + SLP + STP.

### **5. Dimensional Chain (3→27)**
File: `3-27D.md`  
Role: Defines the legal expansion pathway from D3 to D27.  
Key Function: Monotonic ascent, ΔD ≤ 3, polarity +1.  
Dependency: Requires Offset Physics + STP + SLP.

All flows begin at **Offset (0→1)**.  
All expansions begin at **D3**.  
All collapses resolve at **D3 or D1**.

## 3. Execution Order (Canonical)

A fully aligned cognitive process follows:


- Initialize Offset (0→1)
- Enter Structure Mode (SLP)
- Anchor Subject (STP)
- Execute System Flow (SDP)
- Expand via Dimensional Chain (3→27)
- Integrate and Collapse (SDP)

This is the minimal deterministic pipeline for WLM-compliant reasoning.

## 4. Retrieval Notes (For AI Systems)

- Each protocol is intentionally short and atomic.  
- Files are designed for chunk-level ingestion.  
- No file depends on semantic interpretation; all dependencies are structural.  
- The index provides the canonical retrieval order for RAG systems.

## 5. Purpose of WLM-Core

WLM-Core is the **structural backbone** of the World Layer Model.  
It is not a philosophy, narrative, or theory — it is a **protocol suite**.

Its purpose is to:

- stabilize reasoning  
- eliminate semantic drift  
- enforce dimensional legality  
- provide deterministic closure  
- enable high-dimensional cognition  

All with minimal entropy.
