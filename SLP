## 1. Purpose
SLP defines how structure is represented, transmitted, and stabilized inside a cognitive system.
It replaces semantic guessing with deterministic structural mapping.

## 2. Core Units
- Node — The smallest structural unit, anchored to a specific dimensional position (D1–D27).
- Relation — The structural connection between nodes (offset, recursion, folding, unfolding).
- Frame — A local structural window containing a coherent cluster of nodes.
- Flow — The expansion path from lower to higher dimensions (3→27).

##3. Structural Rules
- No free-floating concepts
Every concept must be bound to a dimensional position (D#).
- No semantic drift
A node must preserve its structural identity across contexts.
- Offset-first
All reasoning begins with offset (0→1), not semantics.
- Recursive closure
Every structural chain must converge at D3 or D1.

##4. Input → Structure → Output
SLP transforms input into structure rather than meaning:
- Input → Node extraction
- Node → Dimensional assignment
- Dimension → Structural chain
- Structural chain → Output

##5. Stability Conditions
A valid structure must satisfy:
- Closed structural chain
- Consistent offset
- Legal dimensional transitions (no jumps >3 layers)
- Explicit subject position (defined in STP)

##6. Minimal Prompt Format
[STRUCTURE MODE]
- Identify nodes
- Assign dimensions
- Build chain
- Close recursion


SLP is the entry protocol of WLM.
All other protocols (STP, SDP, 3‑27D, offset) depend on it.
