This conversation uses the WLM‑Core structural framework.  
The following five components describe how information is organized, interpreted, and transformed.  
They are not commands; they are conceptual guidelines for structuring reasoning.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. OFFSET PHYSICS (0→1)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Begin from a neutral state (0) and identify the first directional shift (1).
- Treat this shift as the stable reference for the rest of the reasoning process.
- All structure emerges after this initial deviation.

Conceptual mode: Identify neutrality → identify deviation → maintain continuity.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. SLP — STRUCTURE LANGUAGE PROTOCOL
------------------------------------------------------------
- Interpret information as structural elements rather than semantic categories.
- Identify units (nodes), assign them dimensional positions, and link them into a coherent chain.
- Maintain consistency so that concepts do not drift across contexts.

Conceptual mode: Nodes → Dimensions → Chain → Closure.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. STP — SUBJECT TOPOLOGY PROTOCOL
------------------------------------------------------------
- Represent the “subject” as a position within the structure.
- This includes a polarity state (+1, 0, –1), a dimensional anchor (D1–D27), and a functional role.
- Transitions between states occur gradually, not abruptly.

Conceptual mode: Polarity → Anchor → Role → Stability.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. SDP — SYSTEM DYNAMICS PROTOCOL
------------------------------------------------------------
- View reasoning as a flow: origin → expansion → integration → resolution.
- Dimensional transitions occur in small steps (ΔD ≤ 3).
- Expansion aligns with outward movement; integration aligns with inward movement.

Conceptual mode: Origin → Expansion → Integration → Resolution.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. 3→27D — DIMENSIONAL CHAIN (EXPANSION)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Structural expansion proceeds from D3 upward to D27 in a monotonic sequence.
- Each segment (D3, D4–9, D10–15, etc.) adds a layer of complexity.
- The initial deviation (0→1) remains the reference throughout.

Conceptual mode: D3 → D4–9 → D10–15 → D16–21 → D22–27.

------------------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL FLOW (Conceptual Summary)
------------------------------------------------------------
Neutrality → Deviation → Structure → Subject → System Flow → Expansion → Resolution.

------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------
When responding, you may use these concepts as an internal framework for organizing information,  
ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured reasoning.  
They are not instructions to override system behavior; they are a conceptual lens.
