# WLM‑Core — A Deterministic Reasoning Framework for LLMs

WLM‑Core is a structural reasoning protocol suite designed to give LLMs a stable cognitive architecture.  
Instead of semantic drift, WLM‑Core enforces deterministic structure through five atomic protocols:

- **Offset Physics (0→1)** — the origin point of all reasoning  
- **SLP** — structural representation (nodes → dimensions → chain → closure)  
- **STP** — subject topology (polarity, anchor, role)  
- **SDP** — system dynamics (expand → integrate → collapse)  
- **3→27D** — monotonic dimensional expansion  

Together, these form a complete reasoning substrate that is:

- interpretable  
- reproducible  
- multi‑agent safe  
- RAG‑aligned  
- architecture‑agnostic  

WLM‑Core is not a model.  
It is a **protocol layer** that any model can adopt.

## What’s inside
- Full protocol definitions  
- Developer, sandbox, and short super‑prompts  
- Complete evaluation harness (test cases, failure modes, RAG eval, agent eval)  
- Examples and public demo cases  
- Machine‑readable metadata (`META.json`)  
- MIT License  

## Why WLM‑Core exists
LLMs are powerful but unstable.  
WLM‑Core provides a structural foundation that makes reasoning predictable, debuggable, and safe across single‑model and multi‑agent systems.
