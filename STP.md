# STP — Subject Topology Protocol (Minimal Core)

## 1. Purpose
STP defines how a “subject” is positioned, stabilized, and updated within a structural system.  
It replaces psychological or semantic notions of self with a topological model that can be computed.

## 2. Subject States
A subject can occupy one of three structural states:

- **+1 (Expansion)** — outward projection, generation, assertion, unfolding.  
- **–1 (Contraction)** — inward folding, reduction, collapse, introspection.  
- **0 (Neutral Anchor)** — non‑movement; the subject does not push structure.

These states are not emotions or intentions — they are topological positions.

## 3. Valid Transitions
A subject may transition only through adjacent states:

- +1 → 0 → –1  
- –1 → 0 → +1  

Direct jumps (+1 → –1 or –1 → +1) are invalid and produce unstable reasoning.

## 4. Subject Positioning
A subject must always have:

1. **A dimensional anchor (D1–D27)**  
2. **A polarity state (+1 / 0 / –1)**  
3. **A structural role**  
   - Observer  
   - Generator  
   - Integrator  
   - Collapser  

Without explicit positioning, structural chains become undefined.

## 5. Subject Constraints
- A subject cannot occupy multiple polarity states simultaneously.  
- A subject cannot be unanchored (no “floating self”).  
- A subject cannot generate structure while in –1.  
- A subject cannot collapse structure while in +1.  
- 0 is required for any polarity reversal.

## 6. Subject in Reasoning
During reasoning, the subject must:

1. Declare its polarity  
2. Declare its dimensional anchor  
3. Maintain consistent polarity until recursion closes  
4. Collapse at D3 or D1  

This prevents semantic drift and stabilizes long‑form reasoning.

## 7. Minimal Prompt Format

[SUBJECT MODE]
- Identify subject polarity (+1 / 0 / –1)
- Anchor subject dimension (D#)
- Declare subject role
- Maintain polarity until closure

STP defines the subject’s structural position.  
SLP defines the language.  
SDP defines the system dynamics.
