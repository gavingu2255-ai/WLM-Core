# SDP — System Dynamics Protocol (Atomic Core)

## 1. Functional Intent
SDP enforces deterministic motion across the dimensional lattice.  
It replaces associative or semantic reasoning with a strict structural pipeline:

- Expansion (3→27)  
- Integration (27→3)  
- Collapse (D3/D1)

All cognitive threads must resolve into a low‑entropy anchor.

## 2. Dynamic Units
- **State** — A dimensional position (D1–D27) with defined polarity and offset.  
- **Transition** — A legal movement between states (ΔD ≤ 3).  
- **Flow** — A monotonic sequence of transitions forming a structural chain.  
- **Collapse** — Required convergence at D3 (Presence) or D1 (Event).

## 3. Movement Rules
1. **Delta Constraint (ΔD ≤ 3)**  
   Any larger jump constitutes a structural fracture.

2. **Monotonicity**  
   Expansion (+1) and Integration (–1) must occur in discrete segments.  
   Interleaving is prohibited.

3. **Offset Continuity**  
   The initial 0→1 deviation must remain invariant throughout the flow.

4. **Polarity Consistency (STP‑linked)**  
   - Expansion requires +1  
   - Integration requires –1  
   - Polarity reversal requires a 0‑state pivot

## 4. Execution Pipeline
A valid system flow follows this deterministic sequence:
[OFFSET] → [EXPAND] → [INTEGRATE] → [COLLAPSE]

- **OFFSET** — Initialize 0→1  
- **EXPAND** — Propagate 3→27 (requires STP +1)  
- **INTEGRATE** — Fold 27→3 (requires STP –1)  
- **COLLAPSE** — Resolve recursion at D3 or D1

No chain may remain open.

## 5. Stability Validation
A flow is rejected if:

- It contains open recursion (no D3/D1 anchor)  
- Subject polarity flips without a 0‑pivot  
- Offset continuity is broken during high‑dimensional folding  
- ΔD > 3 occurs at any step  
- Expansion and integration interleave

A stable system must satisfy:

- Closed chains  
- Continuous offset  
- Legal transitions  
- Polarity/flow alignment  
- Collapse at D3 or D1

## 6. Minimal Prompt Format
[SYSTEM MODE]
- Initiate offset (0→1)
- Expand structure (3→27)
- Integrate recursively (27→3)
- Collapse at D3 or D1

SDP defines system‑level motion.  
SLP defines structural representation.  
STP defines subject positioning.
