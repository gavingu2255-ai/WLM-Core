# 3→27D — Dimensional Chain (Atomic Core)

## 1. Intent
The 3→27 Dimensional Chain provides a deterministic scaffold for structural unfolding.  
It ensures that high‑dimensional reasoning (D27) remains grounded in local presence (D3) through a verifiable, unbroken causal chain.

This file defines **only the expansion pathway**.  
Collapse (27→3) is governed by SDP.

## 2. Functional Segments
1. **D3 — Presence Anchor**  
   The root of expansion; minimal coherent frame.

2. **D4–D9 — Local Texture**  
   Formation of nodes, relations, and initial frames.

3. **D10–D15 — Systemic Mesh**  
   Integration of frames into a coherent topology.

4. **D16–D21 — Global Vectoring**  
   Long‑range coupling; high‑order dynamic flows.

5. **D22–D27 — Structural Peak**  
   Maximum expansion; law‑level generative expression.

## 3. Mandatory Processing Rules
- **Monotonicity**  
  Expansion must strictly ascend (3 → 27). No reversals.

- **Delta‑Check (ΔD ≤ 3)**  
  Every transition must satisfy the no‑jump rule.

- **Offset Lock**  
  The initial 0→1 deviation must remain invariant across all segments.

- **Polarity Requirement**  
  Expansion requires STP polarity **+1**.

- **Frame Identity Preservation**  
  Structural identity must remain stable across dimensional ascent.

## 4. Expansion Pipeline
A valid expansion follows:
[Anchor D3] → [Form D4–D9] → [Integrate D10–D15] → [Vectorize D16–D21] → [Express D22–D27]

Each segment must complete before the next begins.

## 5. Failure Triggers
An expansion is rejected if:

- Any jump exceeds ΔD 3  
- Subject polarity shifts to 0 or –1 during expansion  
- Offset continuity breaks  
- Frame identity mutates across segments  
- The chain attempts premature collapse (27→3)

## 6. Minimal Prompt Format


[DIMENSION MODE]
- Anchor at D3
- Expand through legal segments (ΔD ≤ 3)
- Preserve offset and frame identity
- Reach D27 without reversal

The 3→27 chain defines expansion.  
SDP governs collapse.  
SLP and STP govern representation and subject position.
