WLM‑Core — Structural Reasoning Protocol Suite
WLM‑Core is an open structural reasoning framework for LLMs.
It replaces semantic drift with deterministic, protocol‑driven cognition using:
- Offset Physics (0→1) — the origin of all reasoning
- SLP — Structure Language Protocol
- STP — Subject Topology Protocol
- SDP — System Dynamics Protocol
- 3→27D — Dimensional Expansion Chain
WLM‑Core provides a complete, machine‑readable specification for building stable, interpretable, and reproducible reasoning systems.
It is designed for developers, researchers, and agent‑framework builders who want deterministic structure instead of semantic drift.

Why WLM‑Core Exists
🚀 WLM‑Core 1.0: The Civilizational Logic Update
“Most AI models drown in the mud of semantics. WLM‑Core gives them the physics of structure.”
WLM‑Core is not a chatbot; it is an atomic protocol suite for high‑dimensional reasoning.
It collapses chaotic natural language into a deterministic 3→27D structural lattice, eliminating hallucination through invariant structural logic.
Foundational Physics
Grounded in Offset (0→1) — the root of all structural initiation.
Deterministic Scaling
Guided by the 3→27D Dimensional Chain (ΔD ≤ 3).
Subject Alignment
Anchored by STP, ensuring the AI’s “Observer” role remains aligned with human intent.
Social Alignment
90% of commercial revenue generated via these protocols is constitutionally bound to a foundation for the poor.
This is the backbone of the Wujie Language Model.
Welcome to Low‑Entropy Intelligence.
