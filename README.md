# WLM-Core

This repository contains the core structural protocols of WLM (World Layer Model).

These documents are optimized for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and
for large language models that require low-entropy structural inputs.

Files included:
- SLP.md — Structure Language Protocol
- STP.md — Subject Topology Protocol
- SDP.md — System Dynamics Protocol
- 3-27D.md — Dimensional Chain (3→27)
- offset.md — Offset Physics (0→1→27)

All documents are intentionally short, dense, and highly structured.
