# WLM-Core — Demonstration Cases (Readable + Structural)

These examples show how WLM-Core transforms ordinary questions into structured, deterministic reasoning.

They are simplified for readability while still following the full protocol stack.

# 1. DEMO: “What is a system?”

## Input:
“What is a system?”

## WLM Reasoning (Readable Form):
1. **Offset**: Establish 0→1.  
2. **Structure**:  
   - Nodes: {parts, relations, boundary, function}  
   - Dimensions:  
     - parts → D4  
     - relations → D6  
     - boundary → D9  
     - function → D12  
3. **Subject**: Polarity +1, Anchor D3, Role: Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (parts, relations, boundary)  
   - D10–15 (function, coherence)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
A system is a coherent arrangement of parts and relations bounded for a specific function.

# 2. DEMO: “How does innovation happen?”

## Input:
“How does innovation happen?”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: variation (D5), recombination (D9), selection (D12), scaling (D15)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (variation, recombination)  
   - D10–15 (selection, scaling)  
   - D16–21 (diffusion)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Innovation emerges when variations are recombined, selected, and scaled into a stable new structure.

# 3. DEMO: “Explain cooperation.”

## Input:
“Explain cooperation.”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: agents (D4), shared goal (D7), coordination (D10), feedback (D12)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (agents, shared goal)  
   - D10–15 (coordination, feedback)  
   - D16–21 (stability across contexts)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Cooperation is coordinated action among agents toward a shared goal, stabilized through feedback.

# 4. DEMO: “What is learning?”

## Input:
“What is learning?”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: input (D3), encoding (D6), storage (D9), retrieval (D12), correction (D15)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (encoding, storage)  
   - D10–15 (retrieval, correction)  
   - D16–21 (generalization)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Learning is the encoding, storage, retrieval, and correction of information into a stable structure.

# 5. DEMO: “What is complexity?”

## Input:
“What is complexity?”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: components (D4), interactions (D7), patterns (D10), emergence (D15)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (components, interactions)  
   - D10–15 (patterns, emergence)  
   - D16–21 (multi-scale coupling)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Complexity arises when many interacting components generate patterns that cannot be reduced to the parts alone.

# 6. DEMO: “How does trust form?”

## Input:
“How does trust form?”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: expectation (D5), reliability (D9), feedback (D12), stability (D15)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (expectation, reliability)  
   - D10–15 (feedback, stability)  
   - D16–21 (long-term reinforcement)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Trust forms when expectations are repeatedly met, creating a stable feedback-supported relationship.

# 7. DEMO: “What is identity?”

## Input:
“What is identity?”

## WLM Reasoning:
1. **Offset**  
2. **Structure**:  
   Nodes: continuity (D5), boundary (D9), narrative (D12), coherence (D15)  
3. **Subject**: +1, D3, Generator  
4. **System Flow**: Expand → integrate → collapse  
5. **Dimensional Chain**:  
   - D3 → D4–9 (continuity, boundary)  
   - D10–15 (narrative, coherence)  
   - D16–21 (contextual stability)  
   - Collapse at D3  

## Final Output:
Identity is the stable continuity of a structure across time, supported by coherent boundaries and narrative.

# Summary

These demo cases show:

- how WLM-Core handles everyday questions  
- how structural reasoning replaces semantic reasoning  
- how expansion and collapse produce clean, stable outputs  
- how the protocols work together in a readable way  

This file is ideal for public demonstrations and onboarding.
